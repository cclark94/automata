Classes for generating images using cellular automata

"aut" is a Python package with various classes for generating, modifying, and creating images of cellular automata. This is how to access the primary classes:

from aut import *

The "aut" package also includes filters that can be used to modify automaton objects after they have been created. The filters are accessed as follows:

from aut.filters import *

This package is designed for Python3 (I'm developing it on Python 3.6). It requires Pillow for image generation:
