- Randomly flip bits according to a prior probability
- Flip bits according to a specified input file (bitmap)

- New filter: rotate
- New filter: simplify states (e.g., if aut only uses 1 and 2, change to 0 and 1)
- Change PeakAut to sine wave, allow multiple peaks (default 1)
- Rethink patternFilter
    - dealing with overlapping patterns
    - option to negate
- New class: ternaryPeakAut
- New filter: remove top and bottom islands (just like replaceEdgeIslands)
- Think about nixing binary/ternary etc. and replacing with a parameter (so AAut and ATAut would become AAut[2] and AAut[3], for instance)
- In BaseAut, change the generalized... functions to replace the non-generalized functions (i.e., change their names and get rid of the old ones)
- Look into seed 0 -- doesn't seem to act deterministic. Is this intentional?
