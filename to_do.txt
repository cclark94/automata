Add static fields to classes -- min rule, max rule, etc.
New filter: rotate
New filter: simplify states (e.g., if aut only uses 1 and 2, change to 0 and 1)
Change PeakAut to sine wave, allow multiple peaks (default 1)
Rethink patternFilter
- dealing with overlapping patterns
- option to negate
New class: ternaryPeakAut
New filter: combine two automata using logical operators
New filter: remove top and bottom islands (just like replaceEdgeIslands)
